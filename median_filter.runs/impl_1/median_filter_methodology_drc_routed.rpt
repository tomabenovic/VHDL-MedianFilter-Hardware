The timing for the instance RAM/ram_name_reg_1_0, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance RAM/ram_name_reg_1_1, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#3 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance RAM/ram_name_reg_1_2, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#4 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal
